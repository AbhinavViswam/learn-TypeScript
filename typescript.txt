TypeScript is a development tool, the project still runs in Js.
First the code written in TS is converted(transpiled) to Js and then compiled
to do this run the command

tsc filename.ts



syntax :
let Variable_name : type = value 
all types are in lowercase


in typescript we dont use int or float we just use number
